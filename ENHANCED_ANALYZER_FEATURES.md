🔍 COMPREHENSIVE PASSWORD SECURITY ANALYSIS
============================================================

📊 Password: ************************ (hidden for security)
📏 Length: 24 characters
🎯 Overall Security Score: 93/100 points
⏱️ Estimated Crack Time: Centuries
🔢 Mathematical Entropy: 142.5 bits

📈 SCORING BREAKDOWN (Why this score?):
────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Length Score: 30/30 - Excellent length (16+ characters)
✅ Character Variety: 25/25 - All 4 types (excellent)
✅ Repeated Characters: 15/15 - No repetitions found
✅ Sequential Patterns: 15/15 - No sequences found
✅ Common Patterns: 10/10 - No common patterns
❌ Dictionary Words: 0/5 - Found 1 words

📊 Total Calculated Score: 95/100

🔤 DETAILED CHARACTER COMPOSITION:
────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Lowercase letters: 8 characters
✅ Uppercase letters: 6 characters
✅ Numbers: 4 characters
✅ Special symbols: 6 characters
✅ Spaces: 0 characters

📊 Character Distribution:
   • Lowercase: 8/24 (33.3%)
   • Uppercase: 6/24 (25.0%)
   • Numbers: 4/24 (16.7%)
   • Symbols: 6/24 (25.0%)

🛡️ SECURITY VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ LENGTH SECURITY: Excellent protection against brute force
   → 16+ characters provide exponential security increase
✅ CHARACTER SECURITY: Maximum character space utilized
   → Using all 4 character types maximizes entropy
✅ PATTERN SECURITY: No character repetition detected
