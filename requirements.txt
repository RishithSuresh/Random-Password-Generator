# No external dependencies required
# This project uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework - included with Python)
# - random (password generation)
# - string (character sets)
# - re (regular expressions for pattern matching)
# - datetime (timestamps for saved passwords)

# If you want to add additional features in the future, consider:
# - pyperclip (enhanced clipboard functionality)
# - cryptography (for password hashing/encryption)
# - matplotlib (for password strength visualization)
