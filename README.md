2. Enter a password like "password123"
3. See comprehensive analysis with detailed explanations
4. Try a stronger password like "MyStr0ng!P@ssw0rd2024"
5. Compare the detailed scoring breakdown

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies for running (uses only built-in modules)
- tkinter (included with most Python installations)
- PyInstaller (only needed for building executable)

## 📦 Building Executable

To create a standalone executable that others can use without Python:

### Option 1: Use the Build Script (Recommended)
```bash
python build_exe.py
```

### Option 2: Use the Batch File (Windows)
```bash
build.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Build
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name="Password-Analyzer" password_analyzer.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` folder as `Password-Analyzer.exe`

## 🔍 Analysis Features Explained

### Scoring System (100 Points Total)
- **Length (30 points)**: 16+ chars = full points, 12+ = 20pts, 8+ = 10pts
- **Character Variety (25 points)**: All 4 types required for maximum score
- **No Repeated Characters (15 points)**: Zero tolerance for character repetition
- **No Sequential Patterns (15 points)**: Detects abc, 123, qwerty patterns
- **No Common Patterns (10 points)**: Identifies weak password patterns
- **No Dictionary Words (5 points)**: Flags common words

### Strength Levels (Strict Thresholds)
- 🔵 **Very Strong** (95-100): Exceptional security - enterprise grade
- 🔵 **Strong** (85-94): Excellent security - highly recommended
- 🟢 **Good** (70-84): Solid security - acceptable for most uses
- 🟡 **Fair** (50-69): Moderate security - needs improvement
- 🟠 **Weak** (30-49): Poor security - vulnerable to attacks
- 🔴 **Very Weak** (0-29): Critical vulnerability - immediate action required

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

Based on our analyzer's findings, follow these guidelines:

- **Length**: Use 16+ characters for maximum security (12+ minimum)
- **Character Variety**: Include all 4 types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- **Avoid Patterns**: No repeated sequences, common words, or keyboard patterns
- **Unique Passwords**: Use different passwords for each account
- **Secure Storage**: Use a password manager for safe storage
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords periodically, especially after breaches
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA whenever available

## 🎯 Usage Examples
