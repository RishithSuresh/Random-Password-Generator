```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name="SecurePass-Generator" password_generator_gui.py
```

## 📋 **Password Strength Scoring**

The analyzer uses a comprehensive 100-point system:

- **Length (25 points)**: 12+ characters = full points
- **Character Variety (25 points)**: All 4 types = full points
- **Pattern Detection (15 points)**: No repeated sequences
- **Common Patterns (15 points)**: Avoids dictionary words
- **Sequential Check (10 points)**: No sequential characters
- **Length Bonus (10 points)**: Extra points for 16+ characters

### Strength Levels
- 🔴 **Very Weak** (0-29): Critical security risk
- 🟠 **Weak** (30-49): Easily compromised
- 🟡 **Fair** (50-69): Basic security
- 🟢 **Good** (70-84): Strong security
- 🔵 **Strong** (85-100): Excellent security

## 🎯 **Usage Tips**

### For End Users
1. **Generate**: Use the slider to set length, select character types
2. **Analyze**: Type any password to see real-time strength analysis
3. **Copy**: Click copy button for instant clipboard access
4. **Save**: Store important passwords with timestamps

### For Developers
- Source code is well-documented and modular
- Easy to customize colors and themes
- Extensible password analysis algorithms
- Clean separation of GUI and logic

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

- Passwords are generated using Python's `random` module
- No passwords are stored in memory longer than necessary
- Saved passwords are stored in plain text (consider encryption for production)
- Real-time analysis provides immediate security feedback

## 📞 **Support**

The application is self-contained and requires no installation or configuration. If users encounter issues:

1. Ensure they're running Windows (for .exe version)
2. Check antivirus software isn't blocking the executable
3. For Python version, ensure Python 3.x with tkinter is installed
